=== Assist Administration

Within Assist Administration, there is the possibility to centrally manage all system-relevant data. Here, users and roles, 
the document storage folders (RAG), interface configurations, system prompts, licenses, and the system-side 
stored use cases can be managed.
Access to these administration functions is granted via a system-defined, pre-configured role.

===== Edit User

When creating a user, a system-wide unique username must be assigned. This is used case sensitive during login. 
Subsequent changes to the username are not possible.
In addition, a name, a password must be assigned and a role must be given to the user. The assigned role can be changed at any time.
User name editing or changing ist not possible.If an assigned role is deleted, it is also removed from the associated users.

Roles cannot be deactivated and can only be removed in the overview table after a confirmed security prompt.
System-defined roles cannot be deleted.

==== Folder Management

Here, roles can be assigned to the folders created by the system. This controls access to these folders under the "Documents" navigation area.
A folder corresponds in the application to a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation). With Retrieval Augmented Generation, you extend the prompt for the Large Language Model 
with search results, e.g., from the document collection. Therefore, the knowledge for the answer comes from the connected sources.

==== Use Cases

Here, concrete use cases or templates for them are stored. Use Cases are templates for ready-made routines like checklists to make recurring, use-case-organized requests. 
The grouping of the use cases is defined by the system and is reused under the navigation area "Use Cases".

Stored templates can be deactivated. This controls the visibility/availability under "Use Cases" in the navigation.

==== License Management

Here, the license can be managed. There is the possibility to update it if the existing license has been replaced.
Contacting the Assist Service by mail is also possible from here.
