==== Navigation Area "AI Chat"

Individual requests can be initiated here. These can be organized into chats and are saved by the system, meaning they remain available even after the session ends.
Before executing requests, it can be selected whether the document repository or the database should be searched for knowledge. Searching both at the same time is not possible.
Requests can be made via manual text input, voice recording using a microphone, or by uploading a document.

The contents can be saved to the clipboard for further processing using a “Copy” button.

To rename a chat, the edit button (pencil) can be used.
To delete a chat in the tree menu on the left, the delete button must first be pressed and then the deletion confirmed by clicking the checkmark.

==== Navigation area "Use Cases" 

All activated use cases are displayed here, grouped by area. The assignment of use cases to the areas takes place during setup in the administration.
Use cases are lists of use cases stored and approved in the administration, which only need to be filled with specific content before execution.
These lists facilitate routine requests.

During processing, a wait box is displayed and the status history is shown as information.

After receiving feedback on the request, a button can be used to open the "Chat" navigation area in order to initiate further requests for this specific use case.
The result of a request can also be saved and is then available as a separate chat.
To delete a use case, the Delete button must first be pressed and then the action confirmed by clicking "OK".

==== Navigation area "Automation"

Here, if the appropriate permission is available, all automated information sources (feeds) provided are listed and managed.
The highlighted number (in red) shows the number of current results from the latest run. If a read confirmation is set by a user,
the display of new feeds (in red) is recalculated.

image::../images/Abbildung-27.jpg[Navigation area Automation, title="Navigation area Automation", width=400]

To open a feed, click on the icon with the name.

The read confirmation can be set in different ways. If a read confirmation is set by a user, the display of new feeds (in red) is recalculated.
Blue text indicates an unread feed, black indicates a read feed. Each reader can mark an entry as read.
Additionally, the user can use the "I have read it too " button to mark an entry already marked as "read" by someone as "read by me"
Marking as "read" can be done in the overview or in the details dialog.

====  Navigation area "Documents" 

All available and searchable documents for which the user is authorized according to their role are displayed here.

image::../images/Abbildung-12.jpg[Navigation area Documents - delete in tree, title="Navigation area Documents - delete in tree", width=400]

In the tree navigation, only the folders to which the user has access rights are listed.
The assignment of documents to the respective folders is performed in the administration section.

Documents can be downloaded via a button, and the view can be refreshed manually. Since a large number of documents may cause delays, lazy loading has been implemented.
Therefore, individual embeddings (i.e., partial documents) can be manually loaded using the reload icon.
At the top, there are filter options to limit the number of results and sorting options by source, ID, and preview. The filter results update as you type.
Documents—and thus the content of the RAG—can be edited via the edit icon.
